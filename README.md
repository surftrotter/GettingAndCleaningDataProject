##This is the repo I have created to store the files as requested by the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.##

This repo contains 3 files:

- This Readme.md file: a short description of this repo's content 
- A Codebook.md file: a detailed description of the assignement and all the steps I have gone through to complete the assigment.
- A script (run_analysis.R) doing the following:
    1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each             activity and each subject.

I hope you will find the data tidy and the whole repo clear.

All feedback is very welcome.

Thanks.

Riccardo
